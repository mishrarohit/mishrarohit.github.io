    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a freshman in college 4 years back, I was <a href="http://www.rohitmishra.me/blog/2008/11/08/obama-usa-is-back/">rooting big time</a> for Obama. In the process of doing a project on the life of Dr. King, I had read a lot on the movement for equality for Blacks in USA. When Obama was elected President, I saw that as a victory for democracy. People were able to get over their narrow prejudices of  color and ethnicity to choose the best man. It was a high-point for democracy. If India is ever to become a country that we dream of, this will be one of the most crucial requirements. Voters will need to vote on the basis of issues, and not on the basis of caste or religion.</p>

<p>To say that I was shocked by the Republican agenda in 2008 will be a big understatement. Their denial of climate change and slogans like &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drill,_baby,_drill">Drill, Baby. Drill&#8221;</a> made me wonder whether these guys never had those classes on Environmental Science in their schools. I still don&rsquo;t understand how one of the two main political parties in a country with a high rate of literacy and industrial development can be so blatantly anti-scientific. How do they get away with this?</p>

<p>As the election season arrives again in USA, I see no change in the attitude of the Republican leadership. Their callous and boisterous stance on environment continues in the same tone as before. But, the Republican stance on abortion is even more unsettling. I wonder how someone like Todd Akin can remain a viable political figure after saying that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Akin_%27legitimate_rape%27_and_pregnancy_comment_controversy">&lsquo;legitimate&rsquo; rape seldom results in pregnancy. </a> Who knows what the fuck &ldquo;legitimate rape&rdquo; means. Republicans have criticized Akin, but they keep pushing for their so called &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; campaign, which intends to put massive restrictions on abortion and sex education in schools. In his column in the New York Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/opinion/sunday/kristof-scaring-the-voters-in-the-middle.html">Nicholas Kristof writes</a> about the confounding stance that the Romney campaign has taken on issues regarding abortion.</p>

<p>Here in India, we often see politicians  getting away with everything under the sun on the basis of propaganda that their audience believes in without any questions. What the Republicans show us that this will continue unabated. To draw an analogy, no matter how badly the Congress party messes up further in the remaining period of this government, BJP will focus on Hinduism instead of the ills of this regime in Delhi.</p>

<p>Hopefully, we will improve on ethics and not let gangsters contest elections in future, but that is all that we should hope for. This notion that we will start choosing better leaders as India gets more educated is false.</p>

<p>Is there a democracy where the political parties focus on genuine issues, and not use propaganda which says a big &ldquo;fuck you&rdquo; to science? I will keep looking for one.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Advertisements, like most other forms of art, range from the extremely impressive to the disdainful. But, I have always been intrigued by how ad-makers come up with these novel concepts which need to catch your attention and portray the product in a minute or two.</p>

<p>I have <a href="http://www.rohitmishra.me/blog/2012/01/06/think-different/">earlier wrote</a> about what is my favorite ad till day  - Apple&rsquo;s &lsquo;Think Different&rsquo; ad. Here is another of my favorites - the &lsquo;Feel like God&rsquo; campaign from the Indian bike manufacturer <a href="www.bajajauto.com">Bajaj Auto</a> for their <a href="http://www.bajajauto.com/avenger_index.asp">Avenger</a> cruiser.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://harjtaggar.com/">Harj Taggar</a>, partner at Y Combinator,  wrote a <a href="http://blog.harjtaggar.com/time">post yesterday</a> on how he got rid of his addiction to email by deleting the mail app on his phone. He says</p>

<blockquote></blockquote>

<p>The least obvious consequence has been the lengthening of my concentration span, even when I’m at my desk with easy access to my email. I’ve long realized that email is the biggest killer of my productivity e.g. if I’m trying to code I never stop to go and play video games but I did stop and check my email because I could justify it as work (“work” that is both significantly easier and provides a quicker dopamine hit than trying to solve a hard problem). But once I rid myself of the habit of checking email constantly on my phone, suddenly I had less of a habitual urge to check my email in general. It feels wonderful.</p>

<p>I believe this pseudo-work is the biggest obstacle for anyone trying to do something useful. I was a victim of this addiction myself. For a long time, I considered checking Techcrunch, Hacker News, Twitter as part of work.  It is not work. Nothing apart from the next item on your to-do list, Trello, Asana etc is work.</p>

<p>Do a favor to yourself. Stop believing in this broad definition of work.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am currently reading Steve Jobs - by Walter Issacson and came upon the making of this ad. It is easy to identify with this ad today knowing all that Steve did to transform so many things, but, to think of it at a time when Apple was in a horrible shape and had its brand value eroded was such a great idea. This was 1997 - when Steve came back to Apple after it acquired NEXT.</p>

<p>This remains my favorite ad ever.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImE8ZyoKUaQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImE8ZyoKUaQ</a></p>

<p>Text of the ad :</p>

<blockquote><p>Hereâ€™s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. Theyâ€™re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you canâ€™t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. - Apple Inc.</p></blockquote>

<p>You can head to Wikipedia to read more on Apple&#8217;sÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different">Think Different</a>Â campaign. Kudos to Steve and the Chiat/Day ad firm for coming up with this.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>India is one of the few countries where Android tablets are <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/240814/samsung_outstrips_apple_in_indias_tablet_market.html">doing well</a>Â (<em>Android tabs suck because of lack of apps though.)Â </em>. Also, because the Indian market is so price-conscious, I doubt we have huge sales of iMacs and Macbook laptops here. Â So, it is confusing why would Apple push iCloud so heavily in India then. iCloud works well when you have multiple Apple devices, something which is not that common in India. Â And when you are at it, why not address the <a href="http://www.quora.com/iPhone/Why-is-Apple-iPhone-4S-priced-so-highly-in-India">outrage</a> at 4S pricing in India.</p>
