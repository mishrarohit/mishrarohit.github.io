    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Airlines and telecom companies are eerily same when it comes to dealing with customers - total indifference. There is a horrible story at <a href="http://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/08/united-airlines-lost-my-friends-10-year-old-daughter-and-didnt-care.html">this link</a> on how United Airlines left a 10-year child who was traveling on their &lsquo;unaccompanied minor&rsquo; program (costs $99 ) unattended for a long time.</p>

<blockquote><p>United was flying Phoebe as an unaccompanied minor on June 30th, from San Francisco to Chicago, with a transfer to Grand Rapids.  No one showed-up in Chicago to help her transfer, so although her plane made it, she missed the connection. Most crucially, United employees consistently refused to take action to help assist or comfort Phoebe or to help her parents locate her despite their cries for help to numerous United employees.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is not about fancy customer service names or outsourcing. Business is a human endeavor, and this incidence shows how companies like United have become totally inhuman. I am sure there will be a few employees at United who would have done the right thing but, the those involved here didn&rsquo;t and there is not even an official apology till now.</p>

<p>The worrying part is how companies like United get away with things like these. A couple of years back, they had a lot of abd PR when they broke a passenger&rsquo;s guitar. The guy made a video on it,which went viral.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YGc4zOqozo</a></p>

<p>It shows how the average consumer doesn&rsquo;t give that high priority to consumer service than to say saving a few dollars. I don&rsquo;t understand what has led to this indifference in our minds towards customer service.</p>

<p>As an example, I always use <a href="http://www.cleartrip.com">Cleartrip</a> for travel/hotel bookings. They are not the cheapest, but I have seen several incidents where the founders have taken it upon themselves to ensure that their customer doesn&rsquo;t face a problem. Also, they don&rsquo;t put you on hold for minutes when you make a call to their helpline.</p>

<p>I  hope more companies use better service as a selling point.</p>

    <link href="http://mishrarohit.github.io/blog/2008/11/24/the-economic-crisis-simplified/"/>
    <updated>2008-11-24T01:28:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://mishrarohit.github.io/blog/2008/11/24/the-economic-crisis-simplified</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The amount of media attention that the global economic crisis has generated is worthy of creating a newsprint crisis by itself. Surprisingly, very few of these reports have actually tried to simplify the whole picture so that a common person is able to comprehend the economic crisis. One of the major causes of the crisis has been the fact that financial instruments have become so complex that even CEOs don&rsquo;t get a hang of it. Even as the crisis unfolds, the media has failed to adequately simplify maintainig its tradition of keeping things complex.</p>

<p>Maybe its not all the fault of media. Because the crisis itself is so complex that everyone has a theory but no one has a concrete one. So, I will present mine (basically an adapted version of Thomas Friedman&rsquo;s</p>

<p>It started with 9/11. The incident caused a major downshift in comsumer demand. To fight this deflationary sentiment, the Bush administration encouraged people to spend and give a boost to the economy. The housing market was a part of this greater plan. EVERYONE was offered a loan for a house. Many articles claim that the only condition to get a house loan in this phase was a desire to express it regardless of your credit-worthiness. With credit being so easy to avail, everyone wanted a home and got it. The housing market boomed. But Bush forgot to tell Americans to take their legs off the pedal! How could he? He was busy accelerating in Iraq and Afghanistan. And a bubble got created. Prices went up like a rocket. Very soon, people started defaulting on payments. Banks realized but they had already offered too many bad loans which were now defaulting. We got the first buzzword of this saga &ndash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime">subprime crisis</a> Subprime, as I have been able to infer are that group of people whose credit worthiness is below that of a regular income group. A huge number of people were now defaulting and banks were losing huge amount of money. But how, they must have some guarantee?</p>

<p>They had. The house they financed was their guarantee. They seized it. But what next? As the crisis erupted, the housing bubble bursted and prices crashed. So a house funded for say Rs 10 million was only worth Rs 5 million now. Banks lost out Rs. 5 million. And unlike here in India, they couldn&rsquo;t go seizing the person&rsquo;s other assets to recover their loan.</p>

<p>You would have seen and read a lot of people aggressively that stock markets are only a hang-out of speculators and nothing more. They don&rsquo;t have any significant impact on the common man. Hopefully all that aggression has given way to some meditation about the current crisis. As the subprime crisis grew in size, the sentiment in share markets became negative. People thought that it is more prudent to sit on cash at a time when several major financial institutions (Merill Lynch, Lehmann Brothers, AIG) are cracking up. This caused the markets to enter into a freefall. Our own Indian BSE Sensex is down from its high of 21000 to 9500 levels now.</p>

<p>This equity crisis led to huge losses for a lot of people. The profits they had earned throughout their lives got wiped out within weeks and months. This made people cautious and caused the next monster &ndash; demand crisis. Everyone had lost big amount of money? How? Very few people invest in share markets. Yes!! But, where do they invest? They invested in mutual funds and unit-linked insurance plans which are themselves based on share markets.I have written a post related to it earlier.</p>

<p>Now corporations started feeling the heat. Already with banks finding it tough to stay afloat, credit was tough to find and new projects were slowed down. With the depressed consumer demand and cracking stock prices, companies had to cut down on projection and revise their revenue projections. This eventually caused the employment crisis.</p>

<p>Never after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_depression">Great Depression</a> in USA (1929-32) have all these crisises - housing, equity, demand and employment - occured together at this scale. This is why you feel the anxiousness in the voices of even the prettiest of news anchors. (Case in point - <a href="http://indiannewsreaders.blogspot.com/2006/11/delicious-looking-namrata-brar.%20html">Namrata Brar</a> on NDTV Profit. I haven&rsquo;t seen another better mix of beauty with some really sharp economic brain. Yes, I have a crush on her. Lets get back.)</p>

<p>Finally, the most common confusion! With all this mayhem starting in USA and Western Europe, why are we getting involved. I can&rsquo;t give a lecture on how the world has globalised and flattened and become inter-connected. (Buy Thomas Friedman&rsquo;s &ldquo;The World is Flat&rdquo; - preferably through the LibraryThing link on your right. We will and have been affected. But that affect has been mitigated some what due to some prudent and watchful. You don&rsquo;t get a loan easily in India unless you drive a BMW. There are zillions of formalities. And if you default once, your name (using the PAN card) goes on the black-listed credit database that all banks share and you won&rsquo;t get another loan unless your dues (even credit card bills) are cleared. Anyways even if we got easy loans at some time, Indian mentality is not too look for too big too early. However, we got involved at the next stage - equity as a major portion of the money flow in our share markets comes from foreign institutional investors(FIIs). Hopefully our domestic demand will see us through this phase. But to completely restore order, I hope global leaders like Barack Obama, Gordon Brown, Nicholas Sarkozy, Hu Zintao and our PM Dr. Singh make a coordinated plan.</p>

I have fallen in love with watching television due to the brilliant quality that Tata Sky manages on our vintage decade old BPL television. See the picture and sound quality, and you will be convinced that you should also shift to DTH (Direct to home). This segment is very <a href="http://www.bigtv.co.in">Big</a> and <a href="http://www.airtel.in/digitaltv">Digital </a>these days. By the way, that is also the name of the two new competitors that have launched in the DTH space. Surely, there is a big crisis of new brand names when people still launch products with the name â€œDigitalâ€ years after even our bikes engines became digital.</p>

<p>I was recently working on deciding a name for a project that I am doing with a couple of my friends and we also felt it unexplainably tough to come up with a proper name. But, I hope with an advertising budget of Rs. 1200 crore â€“ a combined figure for all DTH operators, there could have been more effort. Now, Reliance ADA (Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group) has named all its entertainment sings â€“ movie production, distribution, music label, FM radio etc. as Big. So, you have big music and big movies&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.. I donâ€™t know what you feel, but I find Big very odd. I didnâ€™t know when using common names as your brand became the latest trend among brand managers.</p>

<p>If this surprised me, imagine what would have been my reaction the first time I saw the advertisement of Digital TV. I thought it is just another feature of their product until I realised that it was actually the name of the brand. Unlike Relianceâ€™s Big, digital TV has no logo or stylised â€œdigitalâ€ text also. Is the economic recession responsible for this too?</p>

<p>No, I donâ€™t think so. This has become a trend â€“ an unexplainable one. Why will someone name his work so shabbily? Earlier too, we have Big Bazaar and while roaming through the Main market area of Ranchi, one of the better shops was named Big Shop. Maybe, it is all about just how big you are!</p>

<p>If companies are doing it for the sake of easy recall among the lesser affluent class, they should have named it Airtel TV, or Reliance TV â€“ that is way better. <br/>
I managed to visit both Reliance Mart as well as Reliance Fresh in this trip. The earlier is based in a large double-storey building while the latter is a much smaller version. Both are part of Mukesh Ambaniâ€™s Reliance Retail. But I wonder if the same group has been behind designing the logo and look of both the companies, Mart looks very cheap and has a bad shade of Red. Someone really watched Om Shanti Om a lot of times before coming up with the staff dress. On the other hand, Fresh looks cool in green (also green n fresh â€“ nice combination).</p>

<p>I have read many a times about the huge scarcity of movie and television scripts. Looks like the problem has spread to the advertising and branding mediums also.</p>

    <id>http://mishrarohit.github.io/blog/2008/10/03/my-marks-wall-street-unexplainable</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thats right. I haver got a 50 in Physics, 47 in English, 44 in Chemistry and a decent 32 in Math. You will say (and Dad always says) that I wrote how bad my exams were. I wrote so, but the marking has been liberal. It easens things up a bit. If I can score well with the input time that I gave before this exam, I can do quite well by systematic studies.</p>

<p>Thats nice and will leave me with sufficient time for working on my projects, which is limited to reading a basic networking book only till now.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Wall Street - the center of world economy (though there isn&rsquo;t one according to Friedman&rsquo;s World is Flat theory) cracked. The companies that were the dream merchants - Lehmann Brothers, Merill Lynch and AIG have gone bust. These companies employed the world&rsquo;s best minds. I wonder how none of them were able to figure out this mess. Its ironical how subprime crisis alone was able to account for all these dream merchants. The whole thing reminds me of a quote by Michael Dell that I read somewhere<br/>
&ldquo;IBM does complicated buisness. They thrive on complexities. We at Dell try to simplify things for our customers.&rdquo; There is a strong analogy with the current crisis here. Normally banks are supposed to take deposits from customers and invest them - earn revenue, pay interest and keep a share of pie for themselves as profit. These companies that have gone bust aren&rsquo;t due to a sudden withdrawl of fund by customers. They have gone down playing in a maze of risk hedging, mortgaging, transfer and insurance of bad assets.</p>

<p>Wonder why none of the best buisness minds of the world ever gave importance to keeping things simple.</p>

    <link href="http://mishrarohit.github.io/blog/2008/06/27/the-service-route-to-sucess/"/>
    <updated>2008-06-27T16:01:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://mishrarohit.github.io/blog/2008/06/27/the-service-route-to-sucess</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As the BSE Sensex tumbles below the crucial 14000 mark and inflation keeps setting higher records, you may find strange to see a post on the importance of better service for growth. Growth, as of now, is nobody&rsquo;s concern. Everyone is looking to counter inflation. I would also have more likely written a post on how to cut your costs using public transport than on service now. But, the actual brainstorming part of this article was done on board Delhi-Patna Sampurna Kranti Express train some 20 days back, when I was coming back after giving my Amity interview. Since then, I have been away from home in Vellore and Bombay, so the delay.</p>

<p>I have often wondered on how new start-ups beat well established behemoth corporations in the battle for market share. Looking at a few examples, I inferred that they come with better products which connect well with customers. Also like any government, large companies generate a lot of negativity â€“ sort of anti-incumbency factor about themselves due to their poor service, which leads to their undoing. Think of General Motors and Toyota/Honda. The one thing that I often read is that India is a cost-conscious country where people are concerned more about the cost than quality. This is an unjustified opinion in my view, as I will show.</p>

<p><a href="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/993399723_573a3c6955.jpg?v=0"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/993399723_573a3c6955.jpg?v=0" alt="" /></a>When <a href="http://www,tatasky.com/">Tata Sky</a> came on the satellite television scene, the general view was that the high-end customers in the metros will move to it. The installation costs were around Rs. 3000 and the monthly rentals were also more than that of cable networks in smaller cities. The lower middle class wonâ€™t be interested. But, the scene developed differently as two examples from my family show. My brother (who as a fresh out of college guy living in Delhi was not on the target-list of Tata Sky) decided to switch to the service after having a fight with his cable operator over poor maintenance. He told me that a lot of people prefer to pay higher cost than being subject to whims of their cable providers<em>. </em>But thatâ€™s not all. One of my uncles who lives in a village in North Bihar has also taken Tata Sky. There the reason is different. Cable providers used to charge a fortune during installation and any problem took days to be rectified. Tata Sky has trained a village man, who is always ready for help. And trust me, my uncle Is a cost-conscious type. But, the service advantage is too big to ignore. I have to concede that even Tata Sky has its share of service woes. It suddenly puts channels in new bouquets which increases the monthly bills and creates a lot of confusion. With Reliance ADAG coming out with its service soon, price wars are bound to occur. Letâ€™s see what happens to service then.</p>

<p> The Mobile Wars</p>

<p>Multiple players, price war and you know I have to talk about our cellular networks. Nothing takes away from the fact that companies like Bharti Airtel, Reliance, Vodafone (previously Hutch), BSNL etc. brought a remarkable communication revolution in India. But, as you may know, our urban markets are almost saturated with new connections and prices are amongst the lowest in the world, so what will be the next attraction for mobile buyers. Vodafone gives a hint with this beautiful ad.</p>

<p>Sadly, our cellular providers have had a dismal service record until now. From unclear plans to special charges and unfriendly customer care representatives, consumers have often been left very frustrated. With number mobility coming soon, which will allow people to change their network without their number, service will become the most important factor. I hope our great entrepreneurs in the field of telecom take note of it and pull up their socks. They just need to give service higher priority.</p>

<p> The Financial Services Sector</p>

<p>One of the more popular attributes associated with our middle class is how carefully it guards each and every penny of its money. But, you will be surprised to know that Indiaâ€™s leading public sector life insurer LIC has a corpus worth hundreds of crores built from the money forfeited by its customers who fail to pay their renewal on time. With the advent of private sector insurers, this part of <em>investments</em> is steadily growing. I will explain with an example. My favorite teacher Archana Maâ€™am got an insurance policy from Bajaj Allianz where she was supposed to pay Rs. 10, 000/- annually for 3 years as premium. She got the policy after continuous pestering by the sales agent â€“calls after callsâ€¦.. you know that. An year on, she forgot to pay the premium on time and was worried that the policy would expire and her investment will be forfeited. It would surely have if my father (who was an independent financial adviser at that time) not helped her out. You can blame Maâ€™am for forgetting to pay the premium. But, I wonder with all the computerization, couldnâ€™t Allianz send a SMS or a letter or a call to remind customers about the pending renewal! Obviously, the sales agent didnâ€™t. How could he? He might have moved to a different company and would have soon turned up with a product of his new company. And we all know that the renewal commission doesnâ€™t match those of the new policies. This is the deficit in service that I want to emphasize upon. The only company that will prosper in the long run will be the one having the best service, as most insurers provide comparable returns on investment.</p>

<p> Final Thoughts</p>

<p>I was peeved to see better service being relegated as something which only the rich clients need. As urban markets mature, it will not only be the biggest differentiator, but also a tool to expand into smaller markets, as the Tata Sky in village example shows. When a person works hard on his own job, he wonâ€™t like to be troubled just because someone else considers his monthly sales target more important than the people who helped him meet an earlier one. Sales and service together only can make a business successful. As I noted down points for this post on the train, I had to stop early. Railways have provided reading lights in air-conditioned coaches. But most of them donâ€™t work. This makes the journey a lot more boring. 30,000 crores of profit has not proved sufficient for Laluji to make the 3-Volt reading light on my berth to work. I wonder what will. No Laluji, the lantern (his partyâ€™s symbol) wonâ€™t do.</p>
