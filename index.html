    <p>I tweet from <a href="http://twitter.com/amishrarohit">@amishrarohit</a>
    and email from <a href="mailto:rohit@rohitmishra.me">rohit@rohitmishra.me</a>. You can also connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arohitmishra/">LinkedIn</a></p>

    <p>I write on <a href="https://medium.com/@rohit">Medium</a>. My earlier
    blog is available <a href="/blog">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I share <a href="http://instagram.com/arohitmishra">pictures occasionally on Instagram</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="shopo">Product Manager at Shopify</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.shopify.in">Shopify</a> helps businesses of all size - from individual sellers to large enterprises - run a multi-channel commerce business.</p>

    <p>I am working on making our product work better for Indian merchants and enabling a new generation of merchants to build their own brands.</p>

    <h2 id="shopo">Product at Shopo</h2>
    <p><Shopo was a chat based marketplace by <a href="http://www.snapdeal.com">Snapdeal</a> which allowed users to buy unique products from shops across India. We were the simplest way for a merchant to start selling online.</p>

    <p>I worked on all aspects of Shopo's product. Building a platform for the aspiring small businesses was a huge challenge and a lot of fun.</p>


    <h2 id="martmobi">Product and Engineering at MartMobi Technologies</h2>
    <p><a href="http://martmobi.com">MartMobi</a> allows ecommerce
    websites built on platforms like Shopify, Magento etc. to build mobile sites and apps using a self-serve platform. Martmobi was acquired by Snapdeal in April, 2015.</p>

    <p>I started here as a backend Rails engineer, but went on to work across
    the stack on multiple platforms including Backbone, Node, Elasticsearch as well as on the product.</p>


    <h2 id="allotrop">Founder at Allotrop</h2>
    <p><a href="https://allotrop.com">Allotrop</a> allowed people to collect
    their recommendations across verticals at a common place. The idea was to
    annotate user's content with real-world entities, and help answer questions
    like <em>"Show
      me all Italian restaurants that my friends have liked in Bombay?"</em>This
    would have searched through the likes of your friends for restaurants
    recommended on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to present you relevant
    results.</p>

    <p>The product failed to find an audience and had to be <a

      down.</a>
