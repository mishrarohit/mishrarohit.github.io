    <p>I tweet from <a href="http://twitter.com/amishrarohit">@amishrarohit</a>
    and email from <a href="mailto:rohit@rohitmishra.me">rohit@rohitmishra.me</a>. Will love to hear from you on Twitter or over email.</p>

    <p>I write on <a href="https://medium.com/@rohit">Medium</a> now. My earlier
    blog is available <a href="/blog">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I share <a href="http://instagram.com/arohitmishra">occasional pictures on Instagram</a>.</p>

    <p>I collect interesting product ideas on my <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/arohitmishra/product-design/">Product Design board on Pinterest.</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="shopo">Product at Shopo</h2>
    <p><a href="http://shopo.in">Shopo</a> is a chat based platform which lets users buy unique products from shops across India. We allow users to open their own shop without the hassle of documentation.</p>

    <p>I work on all aspects of Shopo's product. Building a platform for the next million shops is a huge challenge and a lot of fun.</p>



    <h2 id="martmobi">Product and Engineering at MartMobi Technologies</h2>
    <p><a href="http://martmobi.com">MartMobi</a> allows ecommerce
    websites built on platforms like Shopify, Magento etc. to build mobile sites and apps using a self-serve platform. Martmobi was acquired by Snapdeal in April, 2015.</p>

    <p>I started here as a backend Rails engineer, but went on to work across
    the stack on multiple platforms including Backbone, Node, Elasticsearch as well as on the product.</p>


    <h2 id="allotrop">Founder at Allotrop</h2>
    <p><a href="https://allotrop.com">Allotrop</a> allowed people to collect
    their recommendations across verticals at a common place. The idea was to
    annotate user's content with real-world entities, and help answer questions
    like <em>"Show
      me all Italian restaurants that my friends have liked in Bombay?"</em>This
    would have searched through the likes of your friends for restaurants
    recommended on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to present you relevant
    results.</p>

    <p>The product failed to find an audience and had to be <a
      href="http://www.rohitmishra.me/blog/2014/02/25/end-of-allotrop">shut
      down.</a>
