I went to this post hoping to read about digital convergence but what it essentially is a look at Nokia's way to the top and an analysis of how high it stands!

Strangely, the  post didn't take comments so I put mine's here.  
  
What an article. I had always been wondering that how this giant never shows a slowness in their methods. I live in India - a country that swears by the name of Nokia. From its ruggedness (there are tales about it)to its sleek phones, in every range Nokia rules. After the advent of touch UI, Although, we hated our Nokia phones when Apple IPhone launched but Apple blew it by pricing it at $600. Again Nokia will rule because the much better N97 will come below $300.
