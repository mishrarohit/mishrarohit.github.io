[Techcrunch is reporting ](http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/18/its-official-hp-kills-off-webos-phones-and-the-touchpad/)that HP has decided to kill the webOS phones and tablets. I am sad, but not surprised considering headlines like **[Best Buy asks HP to take back its TouchPads](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/08/best-buy-wants-to-give-up-on-hp-touchpad-has-sold-fewer-than-25000-units.ars)** have been hogging the limelight. I remember being Â super excited when I saw the Pre with the webOS for the first time. As for webOS, Â it is just [so beautiful and functional. ](http://scobleizer.com/2009/01/08/palm-did-what-nokia-rim-and-microsoft-couldnt-build-a-better-experience-than-apple/)

But, Palm slagged off and the might of iOS and Android pushed it into obscurity. Palm ran into financial woes and then was acquired by HP. Â There was a lot of positive energy and everyone was [optimistic what webOS will do](http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/28/hp-palm-deal-webos/) with the financial backup of HP. In hindsight, they didn't do much. I wonder how HP can use webOS now. Windows 8 is itself moving into touch territory so there is no room for another touch-friendly OS alongside it. Apparently, HP will push webOS into [appliances and cars](http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/16/hp-looking-to-appliances-autos-to-grow-and-save-webos/). I am not very hopeful.

There are two things I wonder about:



	
  * HP bought Palm for $1.2 billion. This experiment failed and they have no foothold at all in the mobile market. Every other desktop manufacturer is invested in Android and/or Windows Phone. Pretty smart management huh !

	
  * There were rumors that Palm will be bought by Nokia. They desperately needed each other. Only if Nokia [would have fired](http://www.businessinsider.com/nokias-refusal-to-buy-palm-may-go-down-as-one-of-the-dumbest-moves-in-handset-history-2010-7)Â CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo earlier.
