As the number of student events and alumni meetings keep increasing, it is no longer viable to share all the posts on VIT's [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/vituniversity)Â without spamming the news feed of people who like the page. So, we have decided to share all the events using [Google Calendar](http://google.com/calendar). You can subscribe to the VIT calendar by going to [this link](https://www.google.com/calendar/b/0/embed?src=vitsocial@gmail.com&ctz=Asia/Calcutta)Â and clicking on the subscribe button in the bottom right corner. If you use any other calendar app like iCal, you can subscribe to the VIT calendar by using its iCal address -Â https://www.google.com/calendar/ical/vitsocial%40gmail.com/public/basic.ics

All event organizers are henceforth requested to send their event information at [vitsocial@gmail.com](mailto:vitsocial@gmail.com)Â If you have any queries, you can send me an [email](mailto: rohit@rohitmishra.me) or [facebook](http://facebook.com/rohitmishra) or [twitter ](http://twitter.com/movingahead)for any clarification.

One more thing, one of the major attractions of Google Calendar is how well it works on mobile. Do try Google Calendar on your phone.
