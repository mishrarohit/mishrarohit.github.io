There is an [interesting discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2206437) happening on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) on whether Nokia made the right decision by hooking up with Microsoft as their partner for their future smartphones. I thought this is a right moment to analyze what phone people are really using.

If you are not sure which OS your phone has, try googling your phone's model name and number.

What do you think is the future of smartphones ? Which platform will come out on top ? Share your views in the comments.
