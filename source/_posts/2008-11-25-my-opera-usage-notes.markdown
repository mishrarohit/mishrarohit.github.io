Unconvinced by the indecisive reviews of browsers in Chip as well as Digit, I want to do it myself now. First on the block is [Opera](http://www.opera.com). A very fast browser with die-hard fan base but usage lower than even Safari. Used it for 2 nights and here are the notes:  
Opera Usage Notes  
  
â€¢ Didn't allow other browsers any share in bandwith. Safari, IE showed server not responding while I ran Google Reader on it.  
â€¢ No spell check in Blogger. Firefox had it by default.  
â€¢ My blog wasn't showing up properly i.e. with correct dimensions.  
â€¢ Worked faster I think with Twitter.  
â€¢ Needed flash plugin. Can't it be preloaded or use the IE/Firefox plugin. How many times am I going to install it!!  
â€¢ Interface is better and cleaner. Inspired to clean and improve my firefox now.  
â€¢ opera wants that all feeds should be linked to its inbuilt reader. no i use google reader. bad!  
â€¢ Very peculiar lag while shifting between tabs sometimes like 4-5 secs!!  
â€¢ Got phreaked out typing in facebook  
â€¢ Had to digg. Missed shareaholic on firefox  
â€¢ Labnol had a link compfight.com - searching flickr, site was not able to work on opera! Old problem  
â€¢ Even MS Mesh - the cloud computing next-gen site hung up with Opera. Really not a browser to be used in isolation.
