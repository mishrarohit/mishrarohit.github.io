De Dana Dan is a pathetic movie with no story and little comedy. Very boring. Don't watch it.   
It is the most stereotype comedy and before interval , all that happens is the preparation for a comedy background. All Priyadarshan wants us to do is keep track of mistaken identities and the room numbers that they have to put up in a hotel in the movie. There are very few scenes of the trio of Akshay, Sunil and Paresh Rawal together. Akshay is locked out of action for one hour in the movie.   
It is a complete waste of time and money. Sit somewhere with friends and chat. That will have much more humor.
