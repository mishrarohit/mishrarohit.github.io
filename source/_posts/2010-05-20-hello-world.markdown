So, finally I made the shift from a Blogspot-hosted blogger blog to a self-hosted Wordpress one. I have waited a long time to make this shift. The main reason preventing me was that I didn't want to spend money on hosting.

But things have changed. I got a Dreamhost account which gave me one-click install feature. [Amit Sharma's](http://twitter.com/labnol) description of shifting from Blogger to Wordpress [helped](www.labnol.org/internet/switch-from-blogger-to-wordpress/9707/).

Looking forward to good blogging on Wordpress.
