I have shifted to [Linode](http://www.linode.com/?r=bcc2d975734b43800b9dd375fa8356d2dbd71cc8) from a [Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com) shared account. My Dreamhost account was up for renewal,  and I decided that this is a good time to switch to a [VPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server) . There are a couple of reasons behind that. First, I want to get some hands-on experience running a server.  Second, Dreamhost doesn't play well with Django or Ruby (_anything except PHP, I guess), _which I need for my startup [Allotrop](http://www.allotrop.com)_._

My option was to keep the blogs on Dreamhost and then use [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) for my startup. Right  now, I am working alone on Allotrop, and I don't want to spend the extra hours learning to manage AWS. Over-optimization is one of the more common mistakes we do. I will shift to Ec2 when needed. Also, after doing a fair bit of research, I found out that a cloud service like AWS makes sense once you expect traction. Allotrop is a few months away from launch, and I won't spend any extra money than I absolutely need to.

By the way, if you are just starting out, and want to find a cheap shared host for your Wordpress and class projects, go for [WebFaction](http://www.webfaction.com/). It has awesome support for Django, Rails and other application frameworks.
