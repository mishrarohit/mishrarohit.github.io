[Ankur Sethi](http://twitter.com/ankur_sethi) has done a brilliant blog post on the differences between compiler, C++, Turbo C, IDE (and if you are sane enough to be interested) GCC and Dev C++. Ankur has explained all of it very clearly, so I won't reinvent the wheel. I strongly recommend that you go through [his post](http://blog.uncool.in/2009/04/03/episode-4-things-nobody-will-ever-tell-you-at-least-not-nicely/).   
  
A couple of weeks back, I was talking with my Programming Fundamentals teacher here at  [VIT](http://www.vit.ac.in) about the possibility of completely migrating to Dev C++ at least or dump our Windows 2000 systems in favor of Red Hat/Open Suse running GCC. This will really help in fostering a climate of open-source in the college. For God's sake, Turbo C was developed in 1992 and is completely out of sync with the [new standards of C/C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99). Other schools might need to use some proprietary software but computing sciences can surely take the first step.
