[![](http://www.rohitmishra.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/missmiah_4191979465_comments.jpg)](http://www.rohitmishra.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/missmiah_4191979465_comments.jpg)I think comments are an important part of web. What is said there is as important as the actual post. But, comments are broken, horribly. I think they work well in sites with less traffic. But, for more mainstream sites, they are useless. I have few specific gripes with the current systems.



	
  * Why can't site push to top or highlight the comments made by OP, my friends, and people who I have subscribed to on Facebook or follow on Twitter. I will be more interested in what they have to say.

	
  * Give some method for the OP to highlight those threads which he finds more interesting.

	
  * Also, pingbacks should work much better. Instead of just showing me a link, show me a snippet of the post. How am I supposed to know what to make out of it?

	
  * No matter how good the tools get, comments will always depend on what kind of environment and level of debate people keep up on their sites. Fred Wilson's [AVC .com](http://www.avc.com) has the best comment network as far as I have seen.


I have primarily used [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com) and Facebook comments and the comment system used by Wordpress, Tumblr etc. I am not aware of what Echo and IntenseDebate are up to.

Disqus is coming up with what they say is a new version of their product called [Disqus 2012](http://blog.disqus.com/post/19693554817/disqus-labs). Hope it fulfills few of the things on my list.
