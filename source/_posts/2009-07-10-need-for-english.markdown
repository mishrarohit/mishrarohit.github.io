If you have not seen [TED talks](http://www.ted.com), you are missing one of the best resources that the web gives you. Its just brilliant.  
  
This TED [talk by Jay Walker](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/lang/eng/jay_walker_on_the_world_s_english_mania.html) explores the worldwide mania for English. Walker has got it completely right. In India's remotest villages, the concept of English being a tool to success is crystal clear. Although localization is itself important, there si no doubt that the language of global business and problem-solving is now English. I sincerely hope that like China, we are able to evolve a consensus where every child has a right to quality English education.
