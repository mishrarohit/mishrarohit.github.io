Finally. I am getting my laptop - a Dell XPS M1530. This is the second big purchase of my life after the Western Digital external hard disk that I bought a couple of months back. That costed Rs. 5000. And, the XPS has costed me Rs. 67000/-. Yah, yah its fully loaded with 4 GB Ram, Intel Centrino 2 T8300 2.4 Ghz and a Nvidia 8600 Gt Graphic card. I have ordered it in red, just that something in my life keeps it fresh. No plans of whole night gaming, though. A lot of linux and software development work for sure.   
As my Dad is, he expressed his reservations about such a costly laptop. But, then bought it for me. (Same as with my US college applications.) Trust me Dad, I will make revolutionary materials from this laptop. Thanks for your faith!!
