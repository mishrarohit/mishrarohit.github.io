The second line translates to





> 

> 
> All shopkeepers give this [the candies] instead of a 50paise or 1 rupee coin.

I came across [this image](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=346364805406933&set=a.300054006704680.67810.115989455111137&type=1&theater) on Facebook . Like many others, I am also irritated by Â the replacement of good old 50p, 1 rupee coins with candies. I hear rumors that this is due to the apparent crisis of coins in circulation in the market. It may be true, or this may be a nice trick to increase the revenue of your friendly neighborhood Â shop.







Whatever, I can't wait for the next generation of mobile money to come here. Will [Square](https://squareup.com/) be the answer?
