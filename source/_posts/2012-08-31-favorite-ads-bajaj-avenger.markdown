Advertisements, like most other forms of art, range from the extremely impressive to the disdainful. But, I have always been intrigued by how ad-makers come up with these novel concepts which need to catch your attention and portray the product in a minute or two.

I have [earlier wrote](http://www.rohitmishra.me/blog/2012/01/06/think-different/) about what is my favorite ad till day Â - Apple's 'Think Different' ad. Here is another of my favorites - the 'Feel like God' campaign from the Indian bike manufacturer [Bajaj Auto](www.bajajauto.com) for their [Avenger](http://www.bajajauto.com/avenger_index.asp) cruiser.
