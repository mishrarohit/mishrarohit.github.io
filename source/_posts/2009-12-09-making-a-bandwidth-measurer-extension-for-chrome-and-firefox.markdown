[Satish](http://www.twitter.com/satisheerpini ) ( ) suggested that all of us should actively start doing projects as that is what will help us in differentiating ourselves. I have been thinking of an idea for a while, but have zero clue on the way to approach it and the knowledge needed to do it.  
  
I propose building a Chrome and Firefox extension that can record and display the bandwidth consumed by every tab and give a graph/table for bandwidth consumed in one session. It should show how much bandwidth a particular site consumed in a session, a day, a week etc. I haven't looked for such an extension, but even if one is there, I want to build it.  
  
Anyone who wants to work on this/guide me - please contact.
