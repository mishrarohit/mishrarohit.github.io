> We thought about whether we should do a music client for android. We put iTunes on Windows in order to sell more iPods. But I don't see an advantage of putting our music app on Android, except to make Android users happy. And I don't want to make Android users happy.






_Steve Jobs in his biography_

I am near the end of reading Jobs' biography and I am pretty confident that I didn't see such hate for any technology other than Android. Its ironical how his own thoughts on Windows and Android sound the same. 

Although it never came to my mind earlier,Â  Apple may at some time start thinking about becoming the content platform by letting Android and Windows Phone devices sync to iCloud. No one except Amazon in books, has a better digital content store than Apple. 

A digital content store may become the entry point in to Apple's ecosystem.

Although services like Kindle, Spotify and Netflix are quickly growing to challenge iTunes Store. It will be interesting to see how a post Jobs Apple takes up this challenge.
