I am currently reading Steve Jobs - by Walter Issacson and came upon the making of this ad. It is easy to identify with this ad today knowing all that Steve did to transform so many things, but, to think of it at a time when Apple was in a horrible shape and had its brand value eroded was such a great idea. This was 1997 - when Steve came back to Apple after it acquired NEXT.

This remains my favorite ad ever.

Text of the ad :


> Hereâ€™s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. Theyâ€™re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you canâ€™t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do. - Apple Inc.




You can head to Wikipedia to read more on Apple'sÂ [Think Different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different)Â campaign. Kudos to Steve and the Chiat/Day ad firm for coming up with this.
