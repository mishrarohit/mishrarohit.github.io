I've signed the We Campaign's petition to put polar bears on the federal Endangered Species list. Will you join me? Just copy and paste this link into your browser:

The We Campaign is an effort launched by Al Gore and the Alliance for Climate Protection to promote solutions to the climate crisis. It's an urgent issue, but the climate crisis is also solvable if we work together and unite our leaders around solutions like renewable power and enhanced energy efficiency. We can leave the next generation a healthy climate.
