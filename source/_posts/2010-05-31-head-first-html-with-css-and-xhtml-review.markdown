Head First HTML with CSS & XHTML was my second book in Head First series after [![Head First HTML](http://www.rohitmishra.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/hf-html.jpg)](http://www.rohitmishra.me/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/hf-html.jpg)Head First Java, 2nd Edition. Like the 1st book, this book continues the method of simple, redundant explanations that make the content stick.







The book doesn't cover all the topics but really makes sure that the reader has completely understood the topics being taught. The conversational tone of the book is great if you are learning XHTML and CSS on your own.







If you are getting started with web-designing, this book is highly recommended.


You can buy the [book from Flipkart](http://http://www.flipkart.com/head-first-html-css-xhtml-book-8184040822/head-first-html/1?affid=INRohitblo) for Rs. 440.
