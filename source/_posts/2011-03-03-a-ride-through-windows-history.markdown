There is an interesting video doing the rounds where a smart and _dedicated _Windows fan installs all major releases of Windows from 1.0 to Windows 7. Like every geek, I have had my fair share of Windows installation stories. The first computer I used was in my school CS lab which ran Windows 95. We used to make various _programs _in[ Logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)). I was hyper-excited when we got our 1st computer at home in 2001. It had a Pentium III processor with 64 MB RAM with a HP DeskJet printer. Using extremely slow dial-up internet, listening to music on Winamp or [Jet Audio](http://www.jetaudio.com/) andÂ Â playing [Road Rash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Road_Rash) was all I used to do. That desktop used to hang a lot probably due to a mix of all the pirated games I used to run combined with the extreme heat in [Muzaffarpur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzaffarpur), a small city in North Bihar where I used I do live. Getting the computer '_to hang'_ must be on top among all the reasons I have ever been scolded for. It was only a few years later that I realized that the smart-talking guy who used to repair our computer was charging us big bucks for merely reinstalling Windows. When my brother moved to college, he bought a desktop machine which had heavenly specs at least for me - Pentium 4, 2 GB RAM, DVD writer ... I was so jealous. No matter what I tried, my home system won't run XP Â as XP had considerably higher hardware requirements. It was only when my brother got fed up of his _fabulous _system and sent it to home, Â that I was able to useÂ XP. My love and hate relationship with my computers continued till I got my current laptop an [year and half back](http://www.rohitmishra.me/blog/2008/09/17/my-dell-xps-is-on-its-way/) - a Dell XPS M1530. I do know one thing, the relationship between a geek and his machine is very special. Probably when I have my own car or bike, it will be similar, but I don't think it is going to match what I have with this Dell.
