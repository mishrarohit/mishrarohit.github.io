India is one of the few countries where Android tablets are [doing well](http://www.pcworld.com/article/240814/samsung_outstrips_apple_in_indias_tablet_market.html)Â (_Android tabs suck because of lack of apps though.)Â _. Also, because the Indian market is so price-conscious, I doubt we have huge sales of iMacs and Macbook laptops here. Â So, it is confusing why would Apple push iCloud so heavily in India then. iCloud works well when you have multiple Apple devices, something which is not that common in India. Â And when you are at it, why not address the [outrage](http://www.quora.com/iPhone/Why-is-Apple-iPhone-4S-priced-so-highly-in-India) at 4S pricing in India.
