I often get asked how I manage to spend so much time online. I mostly frequent the below-mentioned sites which bring the best of web to you.

1. Â [Twitter ](http://twitter.com)

You may have a dormant Twitter account or you may be actively following your favorite actor and singer. But, there is more to Twitter. [Infinitely more](http://gigaom.com/2010/12/29/evan-williams-on-web-of-infinite-information/). Twitter is the new [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) Reader. A place where you can get all theÂ interestingÂ things, you want to read and see. Twitter now allows you to specify your interests and shows relevant accounts when you sign up. Let Twitter sink in. At first, it looks like a never-ending stream of incoherent chatter, but you will find great value in this chatter. You can make lists of your favorite tweeps on different topics, and follow lists made by others. I save my expense on newspaper by reading news from Twitter [[news list]](http://twitter.com/#!/movingahead/news) and follow all the latest development in technology by [this list](http://twitter.com/#!/movingahead/technology-news). You can find me on Twitter[ @movingahead](http://twitter.com/#!/movingahead)

2. [Quora](http://www.quora.com)

Quora is the best QnA site on the web right now. Founded by ex-Facebook CTO Adam D'Angelo, Quora lets you ask questions, auto-tags them and shows them to persons who have relevant interests. If you are interested in computing, you will find an amazing community here. The best part about Quora is that instead of people giving their views, there are people who will share their actual experience with you here.

3. [YouTube EDU](http://www.youtube.com/education?b=400)

This is the little-known part of YouTube. YouTube has a program for universities where they allow universities to upload their full lectures on YouTube. You can find plenty of lectures from your favorite universities here.

4. [New York Times](nytimes.com)

If you want to keep a tap with the outer world, there is no better place than NYT. It carries great stories from all over the world. NYT also has an [awesome Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ecmphppfkcfflgglcokcbdkofpfegoel) which shows the future of newspapers literally,

5. [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm)

Last.fm allows you to listen to your favorite tracks off the web. The great thing about last.fm is its scrobbler which is a plugin for your favorite music player. It captures the tracks that you listen to on your computer/phone and then suggests music you will like when you goto last.fm

Similar Sites: [Spotify,](http://www.sptify.com) [Pandora](http://www.pandora.com)

_Both Spotify and Pandora are not available in India at the moment._

6. [Stackoverflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com)

Stackoverflow is a QnA site for programming questions only. If you run into a bug or can't figure out the approach to a particular programming problem, this is the best place to visit, Probably, the question that you have in mind would already have been asked before, so do search before asking a question on the site. And as you will find on stackoverflow, no question is trivial.

7. [Apture](http://www.apture.com)

This is not a website, but a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/cppaadhnncohnjgallikmjdonfliciek). But it deserves a mention here. Apture allows you to highlight a word, and on press of a button, you get a short description of the highlighted text [mostly from Wikipedia], and search results, images, and videos. You won't find it convincing, unless you try it out once.
